   Getting Started <self>
   Reference <reference/stdlibx.itertools>

This package extends Python's built-in itertools with additional utilities for working with iterables in a functional and composable way. It provides operations such as mapping, filtering, reducing, and collecting, designed to integrate naturally with function composition utilities like :py:meth:`~stdlibx.compose.flow` and :py:meth:`~stdlibx.compose.pipe` from the :doc:`/packages/compose/index` package.
